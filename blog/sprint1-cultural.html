            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <div class="main-content">
             <p>At my core, I am a storyteller. I have jumped from job to job in my life – from journalist, to communications professional, to English teacher – but the common theme between them has been a connection with people and place. As a newspaper reporter, my job was to share the stories of the community. As a communications coordinator, I shared stories on behalf of the NGOs I worked for. As an English teacher in Japan, I shared my culture, and shared my experiences of living in Fukushima with New Zealand. I am inspired by communities, by the threads that tie us together. 
            </br>
              Living in Japan really drove home the power of community – I was thrown into this environment where there were less than 30 people in my immediate area who spoke my native language, and I relied on them heavily to survive daily life and stave off isolation. Even though we came from around the world, there was a sense of <i>whakawhanaungatanga</i> between us, strengthened by the experience of being “other”.

            <h2>How do I identify?</h2>
            <div class="main-content">  
              <p>I’m a New Zealand European, cisgender woman, a daughter and a friend. There’s still a lot I’m figuring out about myself. I’m a feminist, a writer, a gamer, a lover of words, games, music, cats and crafts. 
              </p>
            </div>
            <h2>My values</h2>
            <div id="values">
              <ul><li><strong>Curiosity -</strong> We never stop learning, and are all “works in progress”.  We should always keep our minds open, keep asking questions, and consider ourselves as students of life.</li></br>
                  <li><strong>Kindness & Respect -</strong> Practice “radical kindness”, for yourself and others. This is so important in these tumultuous times we live in. Everyone has a right to human dignity and respect.</li></br>
                  <li><strong>Creativity -</strong> Creativity comes in so many forms, and it’s so good for the brain. I’ve had a long struggle with calling myself “a creative” but there are many creative pursuits I enjoy – knitting, writing, drawing, playing piano, or performing in various different ways.</li></br>
                  <li><strong>Relationships & Community -</strong> Take care of the people around you. Your friends, family, significant others, whatever. Pour love in and receive love in return. Cultivate your Team You! The importance of community can never be overstated.</li></br>
                  <li><strong>Open Heart -</strong> Find joy in small things, check your judgment at the door, be good.</li></br>
                  <li><strong>Authenticity -</strong> Bring your full self to anything you do in life. Don’t make yourself smaller to fit other peoples’ expectations.</li></br>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="main-content">
              <h2>In gathering material on this post, I asked one of my best friends how she would describe me. She said:</h2></br>
              <h3>“Iris is one of the most pragmatic people I know, this strongly influences the way she sees and interacts with the world around her. However, she is not a rigid pragmatist but a curious one. For example, whenever she comes across a concept that she does not understand, she seeks out a variety of sources, both written and people, to expand her understanding. It can make her uncomfortable at times to challenge her own beliefs, as it does anyone, but she can be very patient in pursuing things that she is passionate about.”</h3>
            </div>

            <h2>Achievements and ethical decisions</h2>
            <div class="main-content">  
              <p>An achievement  I am proud of is establishing an online hyperlocal “newspaper” with my mother in 2011 for the area we lived in, as we felt disconnected from the community and also felt the traditional newspapers weren’t doing an effective job of covering news on our home turf. That website, <a href="https://www.number8network.co.nz/" target="_blank">Number 8 Network</a>, is still active today. My mother has taken over most of the day-to-day operations, although I help out occasionally. Seeing her flourish as a fully-rounded web editor has been amazing, and as a result we now know people in my hometown of Gordonton.</p>
            </div>  
            <div class="main-content">
            <p>It’s difficult to think of a specific example of an ethical decision I’ve made.  What springs to mind is an ongoing effort to speaking up in the face of bigotry, homophobia, transphobia and racism, which can be very hard, but I strongly believe it’s not up to the members of marginalised communities to fight that battle alone.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Cultural Identity and me</h2>
            <div class="main-content">  
              <p>New Zealand is a beautiful country and I am proud to call it home. My personal politics lean pretty far to the left and I am deeply passionate about many issues around human rights, social justice, environmentalism and equality. I am not naïve to the problems we face in this country, particularly around colonialism and mistreatment of minority groups, and I recognise my own privilege in this system as a middle-class white woman. My values and identity have been heavily shaped by my experiences growing up in a comparatively progressive and liberal country like New Zealand, which was brought into sharp focus while living in Japan and mixing with other people from different cultures.</p> 
            </div>

            <h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>
            <div class="main-content">  
              <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> I am a voracious learner, a jack-of-all-trades, and a good communicator. I’m a naturally friendly person and am generally quick to form bonds with new people.
            </div>  
             
            <div class="main-content">
                <strong>Limitations:</strong> I’m a recovering perfectionist and that sometimes gets in the way of me completing tasks quickly and efficiently. When I’m stressed or struggling I have a tendency to shut down and withdraw. I sometimes find it difficult to find my focus and jump around a lot – this is clear to see from my working history.
            </div>  
              
            <div class="main-content">When I’m excited about something, I tend to attack it with enthusiasm and am determined to do it to the best of my ability. I usually pick up new skills quickly, although I have a tendency to plateau. Being an effective communicator and continuing to hone that skill will be very important for me in my future life.</p>

            <h2>Working productively with others – Story time!</h2>
            <div id="story-box">
              <p>I’ll share an example from my time at the Japanese elementary school I worked at, since it’s fresh in my mind.</br></br>
            In my first year, I organised a video call between my sixth grade English class and a group of kids in New Zealand. I was working with language and cultural barriers with my Japanese colleagues, and distance barriers with the New Zealand school. </br></br>
            My mother helped me find a willing classroom and I worked with my school to get their buy-in. The principal was excited but anxious. He was worried the students would be too self-conscious about their English level, that the Kiwi kids would laugh at them. Japanese culture values perfection and precision, so students generally won’t speak unless they are 100% confident.</br></br> 
            The students practiced greetings and questions in English, and the New Zealand students prepared similarly. I worked hard to reassure my Japanese colleagues, showing them translated plans and timelines.</br></br>
            On the day, the sixth grade class nervously filed in, and the principal and vices sneaked in after them to watch.  When the call started, my students got up one by one and introduced themselves in English. The students in New Zealand did the same in Japanese. They took turns asking and answering questions about their cultures (“Do you play rugby over there?” “What do you eat for lunch?” “Do you play Fortnite?”), then after a quick tour of the school grounds (my students were amazed by the kids running straight outside in bare feet, a massive no-no in Japanese culture) we said goodbye.</br></br>
            The sixth graders were buzzing. They’d successfully conversed with a bunch of native English speakers! The principal was thrilled, and asked me to repeat the project the following year, which I did. We tweaked a couple of things, like getting the students to write their own questions in English.</br></br> 
            When I left the school, my fifth graders were sad they wouldn’t get to call the New Zealand school in 2020. But they did ask if they could Skype me instead, so maybe the tradition will continue in a small way.</p>
