            <p>
            I’ll be honest – I came into EDA without a clear long-term goal or career pathway. I simply came in with a strong desire to learn a new craft, see how the shape of it feels, and work it out from there.</br> 
            In the abstract, distant future, I would love to be a self-employed consultant/contractor, using my pre-existing skills in writing and communication and combining them with web development to make a living from anywhere in the world.</br></br> 
            
            Ideally, I want to work with and for people who are making a real, positive change. I see tech as having such an intrinsically powerful part to play in creating a better world, and that’s a world I want to help shape.</br></br>

            Obviously, I am here to learn web development and pick up a firmer understanding of coding, computers, and everything that goes along with that. I’m also attempting to jumpstart my brain into a new way of thinking and learning, and surrounding myself with an incredible, supportive bunch of humans. I want to take an active part in building this community of learners around me, and supporting them in turn when I can. As well as the hard tech skills, I want to continue to grow as an empathic human being, and bring myself fully into this new challenge.</br></br>

            One of my biggest challenges in life is perfectionism that morphs into paralysis. I am someone who throws myself into things headfirst and do them to the best of my ability, but if I feel it’s “less than”… I’ll freeze up and get discouraged. My inner critic is my own worst enemy and I’m working every day to rationalise and quieten that voice, and try to channel that negative energy into something that drives me to do my best.</br></br> 
            
            I would say one of my biggest strengths is that I have a naturally warm and friendly nature, and tend to form strong connections with new people fairly quickly. Of course, I still have days of feeling weird and awkward… but there’s nothing I love more than going deep on Big Topics with people who I feel on the same wavelength with.</br></br>

            Throughout this programme, I’m 100% committed to throwing myself into the content and making sure it gets done. I’ve found going into the DevAcademy campus during Foundations to be a great strategy for getting work done, and I’ve already made good connections with some members of my cohort, who I have helped and been helped by in turn. I’m being very careful with what I say ‘Yes’ to outside of DevAcademy, and have already turned down a few activities and events that I would normally jump into, telling myself “You can do these things after October”. I really want to be present for the coming weeks.</br> 
            Additionally, I am someone who does my best work during the day, especially the morning. I am no night owl, so part of managing my study and wellbeing will be ensuring I get the bulk of my work done during daylight hours. That’s not to say I’m unwilling to spend some late nights during Bootcamp, but more a reminder to myself to focus every day.</br></br>

            Like many of us, I struggle to know when to swallow my pride and ask for help. I’ve found the Slack channel to be a great resource already, and I’ve been comparing notes and asking questions of my cohort-mates. There have been odd occasions where I’ve called on a facilitator for help with a road block, but in my mind that is a last resort once I’ve tried everything else.</br></br>

            I expect the facilitators to be present in a sense during business hours, but I definitely don’t expect them to swoop in and solve my problems at the drop of a hat. I recognise that they have outside commitments and other students to attend to, and their role is more about nudging me toward finding the solution myself than telling my how to fix it.</br></br>

            As far as outside responsibilities go, as I said already I have intentionally been creating space to complete this programme. I am fortunate in that I am single and child-free, so I am only responsible for myself in that regard. Perhaps the only outside responsibility I have at this stage is to my flatmates (got to keep on that chore roster!) and my parents, who appreciate regular check-ins. I will be spending the occasional weekend at the family home in Gordonton to keep my mother happy, and indulge in a little bit of home baking…
