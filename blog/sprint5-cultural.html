                So here we are in week 5 already. It’s hard to believe. I’ve absorbed so much new information, but the biggest thing I’ve learned is how little I’ve learned. But without further ado, let’s crack into these reflections…</br></br>
                Three things I’ve learned:</br></br>
                1.	I’ve learned that while I have the capacity for a growth mindset, there are definitely parts of my brain that are stuck in that fixed space – when I get frustrated and just want to have the solution given to me, that’s when I know it’s time to breathe, step back for a few moments and recalibrate.</br></br>
                2.	I have an ego when it comes to doing well and being seen to be doing well, and I struggle to show I’m struggling. That’s applies to pretty much every facet of my life and it’s something I’ve been working hard on over the last few years, to be more honest and vulnerable.</br></br>
                3.	I want to comprehend and master everything immediately, right now, and it’s sometimes challenging to slow down and accept where I am right now in my learning-to-code journey.</br></br>
            </p>

        <h2>What was surprising?</h2>
        <div class="main-content">
            <p>
                I was already pretty familiar with most of the concepts in core, but the act of applying them to myself, writing them down and – horror of horrors – sharing them in this blog was a really eye-opening experience for me. I feel as though sharing some of my thoughts and experiences has allowed me to connect more freely with others in my cohort, and likewise the reverse is true when it comes to reading others’ reflections.

            <h2>What was challenging?</h2>
            <div class="main-content">
            <p>
                Opening up and being honest about some of the most intrinsic parts of me, especially the parts that are not so flattering (see above: vulnerability!). I struggled a lot with the very first core challenge, writing about my identity, strengths and weaknesses. It felt like a huge ask, to serve up pieces of myself on a platter for strangers to read about. A tad dramatic perhaps, but it was difficult and uncomfortable for me. I’d say it got easier as the weeks progressed and I started to read everyone else’s reflections, too.

        <h2>Why Human Skills?</h2>
        <div class="main-content">
            <p>
                Because first and foremost, we are humans. Sure, we live in a society that loves to define us by the work we do and the professional skills we bring to the table, and while there is value in those things , it’s far from all we are. Learning web development will help us get a job in the tech industry. Growing our human skills will help us get a job in the tech industry and in every other area of life.</br></br>
                I would never claim the core skills curriculum has been a waste of time! I think it’s extremely important and was a big part of why I chose Dev Academy in the first place.

                    In closing… I’m pretty proud of how much I’ve learned over the last five weeks, and I can’t believe how incredibly fast they’ve flown by. I don’t feel completely ready for bootcamp, but then I don’t think I ever will. So, let’s just get into it, shall we? See all you wonderful people on August 5!
