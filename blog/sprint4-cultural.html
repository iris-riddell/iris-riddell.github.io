    <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
    <body>
            <div class="main-content">
            <p>Are you familiar with the concept of “desire lines”? Those little paths you sometimes see branching off tracks, in parks or on bush walks, formed by dozens, hundreds or thousands of humans going “Actually I don’t want to stick to this path, I want to go that way instead.” I think of neuroplasticity as being like that. If we desire something enough, we’ll build those pathways over time, little by little, like the passage of countless feet.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>The benefits of Neuroplasticity</h2>
            <div class="main-content">
            <p>There is very much a prevailing school of thought that the Things We Are Good At are set in stone. The principles of neuroplasticity tell us that the brain is flexible, that we can be lifelong learners if we choose to be – that it’s simply a case of building up those neural pathways in the brain. Although it is definitely easier to learn quickly when we are younger, there is considerable evidence for lifelong brain plasticity, and that keeping up with learning new skills – be it a second (or third! Or fourth!) language, salsa dancing, or yes, programming – can keep the mind sharp and stave off Alzheimer’s, dementia and other age-related declines in cognitive function. So maybe you can teach an old dog new tricks? 
            </p>

            <h2>Neuroplasticity and Me</h2>
            <div class="main-content">
            <p>At the core, the most basic principle of neuroplasticity is “Use it or lose it”. It’s easy to draw the parallel between exercising your brain, and exercising your body. How many of us have had the experience of going to the gym regularly, building up strength and resilience, only to be taken out of the running by a pulled muscle and being forced to start from scratch weeks later? 
            </br></br>
            It’s exactly the same with neuroplasticity. Regular, every day practice – even 10 or 30 minutes – will bolster those neural pathways so much more than smashing out five hours in one sitting once a week. That’s why it’s so important for me – for all of us – to practice, or at least actively reflect on, programming every day.

            <h2>How to increase your Neuroplasticity</h2>
            <div class="main-content">
            <p>It all starts with mindfulness and clarity, building intention and setting meaningful goals. For me, simply going through Dev Academy has been a vehicle to achieve this. I found myself adrift after returning to New Zealand, as “live and work in Japan” had been such a huge goal in my brain for about six years. Achieving big goals feels awesome but also gut-punches you with “Now what?”
            </br></br>
            Well, enter Dev Academy. Now I have the short-term goal of passing this programme and learning a new skill, with a long-term goal of finding a new career in tech. To help me achieve this, I’m building everyday habits: meditation, exercise (walking, yoga, or bodyweight), journaling, eating food I love, drinking tea and fitting in lots of cat cuddles. That last one is arguably the most important. I’m also making an active attempt to cut down my social media usage, but that could be its own blog post.

            <h2>What is growth mindset?</h2>
              <div class="main-content">
                <p>The growth mindset is a way to see the world, specifically education and learning. The flipside of the growth mindset is the fixed mindset – the idea that there are predetermined things that we can and cannot do. The growth mindset is about valuing effort and intent, stretching and challenging oneself and taking risks in learning, rather than staying safe and sticking to subjects you know.</p>
                </div>

            <h2>Discovery and surprises</h2>
              <div class="main-content">
                <p>The most interesting thing for me is the fact that we seem to be able to… just decide we have a growth mindset? As in, we are not born with one or the other, fixed or growth, but that it is possible to make the shift. Obviously it is not as simple as flipping a switch and saying “Okay! Now I have a growth mindset, hooray!” but it can be done.
                </br></br>
                    I’ve definitely fallen prey to the idea that there are just things that I am Fundamentally Not Good At. Maths is one of them. Drawing, for a long time, was another, until I tried taking part in Inktober last year and discovered… hey, you know what? I might not be skilled in this, but it’s absolutely something I could get better at, given enough time and effort.
                </p>

            <h2>Integrating growth mindset</h2>
              <div class="main-content">
                <p>I feel like the very act of being at Dev Academy is putting me into a growth mindset! All my studies, my career, and my general life experiences up until this point have been very focused on a completely different skillset – writing, comms, and a little bit of teaching – so this is already challenging me to think differently about what I’m actually capable of.

            <h2>Useful links</h2>
              <div class="info-box">
                <p>This is <a href="http://secondwindmovement.com/neuroplasticity/">an article written for an older audience</a>, but it has some good information about keeping the brain active. Besides, nothing wrong with getting a headstart on being an awesome old person!</p>
                <p>I appreciated the grounded description of the growth mindset in <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means">this article</a> for the Harvard Business Review, which provides a good base for what it is, and what it is not. I like the idea that we all have a blend of both and that is subject to change as we go through life.</p>
