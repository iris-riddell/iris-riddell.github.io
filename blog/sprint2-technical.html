    <h1>Understanding Classes and IDs</h1>
</header>

<body>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="main-content"> 
      <p>You don’t have to delve too deep into learning HTML and CSS to start seeing the terms “id” and “class” being liberally thrown around. But what are they, and what do they do? Well to answer the first question, they’re both selectors; they perform similar jobs but in slightly different ways. As web developers we may not have hammers and nails to build our sites, but it’s just as important for us to know our way around the items in our toolbox. So what’s a newbie developer to do?</p>
  </div>

<h2>Let’s start with the basics.</h2>
  <div class="basics">
      <p>Baby steps. Here’s what a class looks like in the HTML, and CSS respectively:</p></br>

    </div>

  <div class="basics">
        <p>Easy so far? Awesome. Let’s compare it with an id, in the HTML and CSS again:</p></br>
        <a href="https://gyazo.com/acb7e7d519631578ed814681bef3cdef"><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/acb7e7d519631578ed814681bef3cdef.png" alt="Image showing id markup in html" width="440"/></a>
        <a href="https://gyazo.com/c408bb60574be696bda4338e67f5b517"><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/c408bb60574be696bda4338e67f5b517.png" alt="Image showing id markup in css" width="440"/></a>
    </div>

    <div class="main-content">
        <p>You’ll notice the class is applied to an element with <strong>class=”class-name-here”</strong> and denoted in the associated CSS file with a <bold>#hash</bold>. The id is slightly different - it’s written as <strong>id=”id-name-here”</strong> in the HTML, and marked with a <strong>.fullstop</strong> in the CSS file.</p>
    </div>

  <h2>That’s great but… when do I use them?</h2>
  <div class="main-content">
    <p>Okay, we know how to identify a class and an id. But how the heck do you use them in practice?
    </br>
</br>
    Well, the id is a bit of a prima donna. It only wants to talk to one element, and one element alone. The class on the other hand is a cheerful, outgoing soul – it can be applied to as many elements as you want!
</br>
</br>
Since ids are unique and demand to be treated with respect, it’s best to use them for situations where you only have a single instance within your code, like a header or footer. Classes, on the other hand, can be applied to things like photographs or blocks of text. 
</br>
</br>
Even though ids don’t like to mingle with multiple elements, they’ll happily mix with classes so things like this are totally okay:
        </p>
        <div class="container">
        <a href="https://gyazo.com/f898194b80594549792dc58ba8cc4ae5"><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/f898194b80594549792dc58ba8cc4ae5.png" alt="Image from Gyazo" width="440"/></a>
    </div>
</div>

  <h2>To summarise…</h2>
  <div class="main-content">
    <p>Classes can be used multiple times within a markup document, while ids – which carry more weight – can only be used once. When deciding whether to use a class or id, ask yourself whether it’s likely to be the only instance of that selector within your stylesheet. If it’s a photo or text styling, opt for a class. If it’s a navbar, header or footer, slap it with an id.
    </br>
    </br>
    Regardless, the best way to get a handle on classes versus ids is to get out there and give it a crack.</p>
