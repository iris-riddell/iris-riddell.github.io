    <h1>Understanding Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <body>
            <div class="main-content">
            <p>Emotional Intelligence is one of those topics I love to geek out about. I remember learning the term for the first time in a Leadership 101 paper at university, and the concept immediately enthralled and excited me. I’d never before considered that “social skills” could be practiced and consciously improved like any other skill could, even though the word is right there in the name.</p>

                <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
            <div class="main-content">
            <p>Broadly, emotional intelligence encompasses what we might refer to as “soft skills” – empathy, compassion, expressing emotions, managing feelings, communicating effectively and so forth. Often shortened to EQ, it is something of a foil to the more widely understood IQ, which is used to measure a person’s intellect.

            <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
            <div class="main-content">
            <p>Having a high IQ is generally associated with being “book smart” – being good at, say, mathematics or science. By contrast, EQ is more closely linked to social skills and understanding emotions, both our own and the emotions of others.

            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
            <div class="main-content">
          
            <p>Sometimes in life, cleverness alone is not enough, and we rely on the people around us to get through. That’s where EQ comes in. Being able to effectively empathise with another person, or accurately express feelings – whether they be positive or negative – is an important part of navigating the world. This applied to every level of interpersonal communication: to familial relationships, friendships, romantic and sexual relationships, professional relationships, everything. In a professional context, more and more recruiters are hiring for “cultural fit” rather than technical skill.
