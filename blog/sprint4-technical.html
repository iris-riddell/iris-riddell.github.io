    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <body>
        <div class="main-content">
            <p>Getting hopelessly, screamingly, ragingly stuck is something I’m sure we’re all familiar with now, as well as the flipside feeling of figuring out what was wrong and realising that actually, it wasn’t so hard all along!</p>

                    I think the worst (but not the first!) I’ve been stuck was during the dots counting game in sprint 3. I got through steps 1-7 relatively scot free. A few hiccups here and there, but overall… fairly painless. But step 8, oh, step 8! 
                    </br></br>
                    I rewrote code, I deleted chunks, I Googled, I copy-pasted, I said a few choice words, tried something else, broke the whole thing and hastily CTRL-Z’d my way back to safety… it wasn’t pretty. Eventually I admitted defeat and posted in the group Slack, and some wise fellow Foundations students came to my rescue. Although I wish I’d discovered the solution myself, it was good to know that help was at hand.
                    </br></br>
                    After a little bit of tinkering, my code was working a treat. Mission accomplished.

                    The feelings that go along with getting stuck and unstuck could not be more different. While I’m trying to solve a problem, I’m irritable and flustered, questioning every decision I’ve made that led me to this point and my very existence on this earth. But after getting unstuck on a problem, wow what a rush! It’s like a shot of buzzing energy. Right until I get blocked again two minutes later, but hey.
                    </br></br>
                    What I take away from the whole experience of getting stuck is this: It’s going to happen, it’s going to be frustrating, and that’s okay. There are ways to navigate around them, and it’s important to keep pushing. There is not a single developer out there who sits down and writes lines of beautiful , flowing, perfect code for hours without encountering a single error message, and if there is… well, we need to hunt them down and steal their secrets.

                    I would say that <i>Googling</i> and <i>reflecting</i> are on the top of the pile for me right now in terms of getting unstuck, followed by <i>trying something</i> and <i>asking peers or coaches</i> for help. I certainly wouldn’t want to ask for help without attempting to fix the situation myself! I am trying to get the hang of <i>pseudocode</i> since it seems very useful, and I still feel rather out of my depth with making sense of <i>error messages</i> and <i>console.logging</i>. The <i>rubber ducky method</i> seems absolutely charming and I must see about getting myself one of those, although I have discussed a lot of code with my cat…
